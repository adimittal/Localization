of our service areas is available on the Website but Services may not be
available everywhere or with certain rate plans, promotions, options or offers
and you acknowledge that our coverage maps only approximate our anticipated
wireless coverage area outdoors under optimal conditions.&nbsp; Moreover, the
service areas may either increase or decrease from time to time. The actual
service area, coverage and quality of service may fluctuate based on numerous
factors, including without limitation, signal strength, network congestion or
capacity, hardware, software, server speeds of the websites, portals or other
locations on the Internet that you use with Devices and Services, the weather
and any other factors that are beyond our control.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style="vertical-align:baseline"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:

agents, representatives or advertisers relating to the availability of our
Services and/or the coverage of the wireless network used by our Services are
only intended to describe the approximate coverage and availability of the
Services.&nbsp; You should not interpret any such statements to mean that the
Services will be available under all circumstances, at all times, or without
interruption in your service area. You agree we are not liable for problems
relating to Service availability.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style="vertical-align:baseline"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:

which the Services are provided (which may be caused by problems that our
service providers or roaming partners are having), signal strength, hardware,
software, structures, geographic, topographic or atmospheric conditions, Force
Majeure Events, and other conditions that are beyond our control. We do not
warrant or guarantee that the Services will be available at any specific time
or geographic location, or that the Services will be provided without
interruption or at any particular quality level.&nbsp; Outages and
interruptions in the Service may occur, and the speed of Service can vary based
on a variety of conditions, including those listed above. Therefore, the
Services, including calls or attempted calls to emergency services like 911
calls, may be interrupted or fail, and/or the quality of calls may be
poor.&nbsp; Services that rely on location information, such as E911, GPS
navigation, may depend on network coverage and may depend on the Devices’
ability to acquire satellite signals (typically not available indoors) or cell
antenna sites. While Devices are installing a software update, users may be
unable to use Devices for any purposes, including the placing of calls to
emergency services operators, until the software update is installed. You agree
we are not liable for problems relating to the quality of the Services.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

nature of wireless technologies, our network generally has information that can
be used to determine the location of Devices when they are outdoors and/or
turned on.&nbsp; These technologies allow us and/or third parties to provide
emergency 911 services, as well as other location-based services. Network
coverage or environmental factors (such as structures, buildings, weather,
geography, landscape, topography and atmospheric conditions) can impact the
ability to access Devices’ location information and use of location-based
services.&nbsp; Thus, even if Devices and&nbsp;Services appear to be
functioning properly, location data may not be automatically available at any
given time.&nbsp;<br>You agree that any authorized user of Devices associated with the Services may
access and use location-based services that are installed on Devices. You
authorize <span class="SpellE">ItsOn</span> or any applicable third-party
applications or services installed on Devices that use location-based technologies
to use these location-based services to determine the location of the Devices,
which could include the relevant user’s location or any authorized user of Devices
at any given time.&nbsp;&nbsp;You understand that your use of location-based applications
is subject to the applications’ or relevant services’ providers terms and
conditions and other policies relevant to third-party applications or services.&nbsp;
If location-based services are activated for any Devices, you agree that you
are required to inform all authorized users of your Devices of these Terms, as
well as any applicable third-party terms of use and any other relevant
policies.&nbsp; Additional information concerning location-based services is
available in our Privacy Policy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

discretion.&nbsp; Users’ ability to roam is dependent on a number of factors,
including the radio transmissions that Devices can acquire. We make no
guarantee that Domestic Roaming coverage will be available. Depending on Device
settings, users may automatically roam if there is a gap or interruption in
coverage within our network area and roaming coverage areas. Limits on the
amount of minutes, number of texts, and amount or speed of data services used
while roaming may be applied.&nbsp; Certain Services or Service features&nbsp;may
not be available in roaming coverage areas, and call quality may be lower while

font-family:Calibri"><br></span></b><span style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Calibri">Public Safety
Officials advise that when making 911 or other emergency calls, users should
always be prepared to provide location information. Unlike traditional <span class="SpellE">wireline</span> phones, depending on a number of factors (for
example, whether Devices are GPS enabled, where users are placing emergency
calls from, whether local emergency service providers have upgraded their
equipment, etc.), 911 operators may not know the emergency caller’s phone
number, location, nor the location of the caller’s Device. In certain
circumstances, an emergency call may be routed to a state patrol dispatcher or
alternative location set by local emergency service providers.&nbsp; Enhanced
911 services (“E911”), where enabled by local emergency authorities, use GPS
technology to provide location information or other methods to automatically
determine callers’ locations. Even when available, however, E911 does not
always provide accurate location information.&nbsp; If your Device is indoors
or for some other reason cannot acquire a satellite signal, or cannot obtain
other information used to determine callers’ locations, your location
information may not be automatically delivered to emergency call takers. Some
Devices have a safety feature that prevents use of the keypad after dialing 911
- you should follow voice prompts when interacting with emergency service
providers employing IVR systems to screen calls.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
